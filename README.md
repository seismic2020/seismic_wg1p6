 Code for [SEISMIC Working Group 1 (Measurements) Project 6](https://www.seismicproject.org/working-groups/measurement/) : Equity Gaps in Upper Division Courses
 
 Created as part of the SEISMIC Summer Measurements Fellowship 2021
 
 # Project Goal
 This project aims to examine equity gaps associated with race/ethnicity, gender, first-generation status, low income status, international and transfer student status on equity gaps in upper-division science courses at various institutions. Ideally, the code in this repository will be used to analyse data from a variety of courses and institutions. 
 
 The goal of this code repository is to provide code that returns summary statistics, demographic information and mixed model outputs for a variety of course datasets.  To run, this code requires the R Statistical language and a dataset formatted in the described SEISMIC format (see more below).
 
 # How to run Code 
 
 ##  Dataset Preparation 
 
 Before running the code, ensure your data is formatted in the described SEISMIC format. Please reference this [data description]() for the correct variable names and 
Course-level variables and student-level variables should be included in the same data table. Course-level variables should be present as separate columns. For instance, if students took multiple courses at an institution,
